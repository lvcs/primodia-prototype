# PRD009 - Trees Feature Requirements

## Overview
Add simple visual trees to wood/forest tiles for aesthetic enhancement. This is a low-priority visual feature that should be implemented simply and efficiently.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Tree Visual Design

#### 1.1 Basic Shape
- **Geometry**: Simple tree composed of two basic shapes:
  - **Trunk**: Cylinder (brown colored)
  - **Canopy**: Cone on top of cylinder (green colored)
- **Materials**: Basic Three.js materials

#### 1.2 Simple Randomization
Trees should have basic randomized properties:
- `height`: Total tree height with some variation
- `radius`: Tree width with some variation  
- `rotation`: Random Y-axis rotation

#### 1.3 Default Values
- Base height: 3.0 units
- Base radius: 1.0 units
- Simple random variation: Â±20%

### 2. Tile Population

#### 2.1 Placement Rules
- Trees only appear on wood/forest tiles
- Random placement within tile boundaries
- Simple spacing to avoid obvious overlaps

#### 2.2 Tree Count
- Fixed number of trees per wood tile (e.g., 3-5 trees)
- Random count within range for variety

### 3. Configuration

#### 3.1 Basic Configuration
- Tree count range per tile
- Size variation ranges
- Basic colors for trunk and canopy

### 4. Implementation Approach

#### 4.1 Simple Generation
- Generate trees randomly when tiles are rendered
- No need for deterministic placement or complex algorithms
- Use basic Math.random() for simplicity

#### 4.2 Performance
- Use geometry instancing for better performance
- Dispose trees when tiles are out of view

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Requirements
- [ ] Trees appear on wood/forest tiles
- [ ] Trees have basic size and rotation variation
- [ ] Trees don't obviously overlap
- [ ] Trees stay within tile boundaries

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] No noticeable performance impact
- [ ] Trees are disposed when not needed

### Implementation Requirements
- [ ] Simple, minimal code
- [ ] Easy to configure basic parameters
- [ ] Integrates with existing tile system

## Dependencies
- Three.js geometry and materials
- Existing tile rendering system
- Basic configuration system

## Estimated Complexity
**Very Low** - Simple visual enhancement with minimal complexity.
