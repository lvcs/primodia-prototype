# 🌍 Project Primodia - Game Vision

## 💡 1. Overview & Concept

Project Primodia is a 4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) grand strategy game set on a procedurally generated 3D hexagonal globe, playable in a web browser. It combines the epic scale and strategic depth of the *Civilization* series, particularly *Civilization VI*, with intricate city-level economic management and development inspired by city-builder classics like *Caesar*, *Pharaoh*, and *Zeus*, and a touch of the societal/political management found in games like *Tropico*.

Players will lead a fledgling civilization from its earliest days, guiding its growth, managing its economy, advancing its technology and culture, engaging in diplomacy and warfare, and ultimately striving to achieve one of several distinct victory conditions.

## 🔄 2. Core Gameplay Loop

Players will engage in a turn-based cycle of:

*   🗺️ **Exploration:** Sending out units to uncover the map, discover natural wonders, resources, other civilizations, and strategic locations.
*   🏙️ **Expansion:** Founding new cities, expanding borders, and establishing a network of interconnected settlements.
*   ⚙️ **Exploitation:** Developing land, extracting resources, building infrastructure, and managing complex production chains to meet citizen needs and fuel the empire's growth.
*   ⚔️ **Extermination (and Interaction):** Engaging in diplomacy, trade, espionage, cultural influence, religious spread, and, when necessary, military conflict with other civilizations (both AI and human players).
*   🔬 **Advancement:** Researching technologies, unlocking new civics and cultural policies, and developing religious beliefs to gain new abilities, units, buildings, and strategic options.
*   🏘️ **City Management:** Focusing on the detailed economic and logistical challenges within each city, ensuring resource availability, worker allocation, service provision, and citizen happiness/stability, drawing heavily from the mechanics of classic city-builders.

## ✨ 3. Key Features

### 🌐 3.1. World & Map

*   **Procedurally Generated Globe:** Each game takes place on a unique, seamless 3D globe composed of hexagonal tiles.
*   **Diverse Terrains & Climates:** Varied biomes, landforms (including mountain ranges, plateaus, valleys, and cliffs), elevation changes, and climate zones affecting resource availability, movement, city placement, and agricultural potential.
*   **Elevation:** Meaningful differences in elevation, creating natural barriers like mountain ranges and cliffs, impacting visibility, combat, resource distribution, and susceptibility to certain environmental effects (e.g., flooding, weather patterns).
*   🏞️ **Rivers & Water Bodies:** Navigable and non-navigable rivers, lakes, and coastlines that affect movement, trade, city development (freshwater access), and provide resources.
*   **Strategic Resources:** Essential resources (e.g., iron, horses, oil, uranium, luxury goods) scattered across the globe, crucial for advanced units, buildings, and economic prosperity.
*   🌟 **Natural Wonders:** Unique and visually striking map features, often tied to specific geographical formations (like towering mountain ranges, vast cliffs, unique geological formations, or lush oases), providing significant local or empire-wide bonuses and potentially inspiring cultural or religious developments.
*   🌋 **World Events & Disasters:**
    *   Dynamic events such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, droughts, storms, and disease outbreaks that can impact tiles, cities, and units.
    *   Specific environmental cycles, e.g., flooding depending on the moon phases affecting coastal or riverside areas, requiring adaptive strategies.

### 👑 3.2. Civilizations & Leaders

*   **Unique Civilizations:** A roster of distinct civilizations, each with unique abilities, units, buildings/districts, and leader bonuses, offering diverse playstyles (inspired by Civ VI).
*   **Leader System:** Leaders provide an additional layer of unique perks and playstyle emphasis.
*   🏭 **Detailed Production Chains:** Cities require raw materials to be extracted (e.g., from mines, farms, lumber mills), processed by specific industries (e.g., smelters, weavers, mills), and then manufactured into finished goods (e.g., tools, clothing, processed food) and amenities.
*   🚚 **Resource Distribution & Logistics:** Goods must be physically transported from production sites to storage (granaries, warehouses), markets, consumers, and potentially other cities. Infrastructure like Roads, Railways (for Trains), and later potentially advanced transit networks (e.g., for Planes in a civilian/cargo context) will be critical for efficiency.
*   😊 **Citizen Needs & Happiness:** Citizens have evolving needs (food variety and quantity, housing quality, specific consumer goods, services like healthcare and Entertainment, access to Education) that must be met to ensure happiness, growth, social stability, and prevent unrest. Different social strata or pop types may have different needs and expectations.
*   👷‍♂️ **Labor Management & Labour Pooling:** Workers are a finite resource, often categorized by skill or social class. Industries and services require specific numbers of workers. Systems for empire-wide or regional labour pooling might exist, allowing for more dynamic allocation. Unemployment or labor shortages will impact city function and citizen happiness.
*   🚶‍♀️ **Population Migration System:** Citizens may migrate between cities within an empire (or even attempt to emigrate/immigrate) based on factors like economic opportunity, happiness, housing availability, taxation, and environmental conditions.
*   💧 **City Services:** Provision of services like water access, sanitation, healthcare, Entertainment (theaters, arenas, etc.), Education (libraries, universities), religious access, and public order (policing/garrisons) directly impacts citizen well-being, productivity, and city development potential.
*   **Specialized Districts/Buildings:** Cities can construct various specialized districts (e.g., industrial, commercial, agricultural, residential, administrative, military, cultural, research) and individual buildings that facilitate the above economic activities and provide specific bonuses.
*   🌾 **Villages & Rural Development:** Smaller settlements or rural population centers that might exist within a city's sphere of influence or as independent entities, focusing on raw resource production and interacting with larger urban centers.
*   🏛️ **Monuments and Monument Construction:** Beyond standard buildings and Wonders, civilizations can undertake large-scale monument construction projects, requiring significant investment of resources and labor over time, yielding powerful cultural, religious, or morale bonuses.
